XPATH

PROS
-> can search both forward and backward (CSS selector can only search forward).
-> can search with displayed text.
-> can locate by index

CONS
-> works slower than other methods

/html/body/div/h1   -> Absolute XPATH

tagName[attribute='value'] -> CSS selector

**************
* For XPATH: *
**************
//tagName[@attribute='value'] -> Relative XPATH

So there are two types of XPATH - absolute and relative. We use only the latter, the former is the worst method.

//tagName[text()='text'] -> to locate a text

// input[starts-with(@id,'syx_e')] -> element that has an id that starts with "syx_e"

// input[contains(@id,'tzn')] -> element that has an id that contains "tzn"

//div[contains(text(),'how you use XYZ')] -> element that has a visible text and contains "how you use XYZ"

//input[@type='hidden' and @name='syx_tzn'] -> element that has both of these attributes
//input[@type='hidden' or @name='syx_tzn'] -> element that has either type or name attribute

tagName[attribute='value']> -> CSS child
//div[@id='user-name']/input[@type='text'] -> single slash serves for searching among the immediate children
//div[@id='user-name']//input[@type='text'] -> double slash serves for searching among the entire family(children and grandchildren)

//ul[@class='nav navbar-nav']//li/following-sibling::li[@class='dropdown'] -> first sibling
        (ul is parent)     (li is 1st child) (following sibling)

//ul[@class='nav navbar-nav']//li/following::li[@class='dropdown'] -> li elements among all siblings after the first child

**************************************************
*How to locate a parent by starting from a child:*
**************************************************

//button[text()='Show Message']/.. -> a slash and the double dot locates the parent of that child button
//button[text()='Show Message']/parent::form -> slash, parent keyword and the tag name of the parent locates the parent as well.
//button[text()='Show Message']/../.. -> locates the grandparent
//button[text()='Show Message']/parent::form/parent::div -> also locates the grandparent

//button[@class='btn btn-primary'])[2] -> locates the 2nd of button elements with same locator

Priority Order of the locators:
1. ID
2. name
3. class
4. linkText (for a tag)
5. partialLinkText (for a tag)
6. tagName
7. CSS selector
8. XPATH
